I was first asked to complete a series of tasks to produce a deliverable within two days. Datasets can be provided upon request, they are too big to post on Github. Later, I realized the tasks given were not strong enough to solve the business question, so I did a new analysis solving the business question of stagnation in sales in WSW_ver2.ipynb.

WSW_ver1.ipynb mainly shows...
- tagging, sorting
- sentiment analysis
- learning and trying new materials

WSW_ver2.ipynb mainly shows...
- problem solving
- goal-driven data analysis
- visualization
- data cleaning and filtering
