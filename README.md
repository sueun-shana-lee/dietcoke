I was first asked to complete a series of tasks to produce a deliverable within two days. Datasets can be provided upon request, they are too big to post on Github. I am currently analyzing this in new perspective, applying new analysis methods, and making the code more efficient using Python (of course), SQL and more

For Python, I am updating various versions of codes to give you the most compatible option. All codes under the same name essnetially includes the same code, so feel free to open the one with the extenstion you are most comfortable with.
